iTunes.py
=========

For now, this is just a command-line interface to Python. It's pretty
simple, but I am considering making it do a lot of more interesting
things as time goes by.

It's not in pip, because working with PIL is a horrible experience that
I will worry about some other time.

Usage
-----

Put itunes.py somewhere in your path. Now, you can do things like this:

    itunes.py play
    itunes.py pause
