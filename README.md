cliTunes
=========

For now, this is just a command-line interface to iTunes. It's pretty
simple, but I am considering making it do a lot of more interesting
things as time goes by.

Installation
------------

To install, simply use **pip** or **easy_install**:

    easy_install clitunes

Usage
-----

Put bin/clitunes somewhere in your path. Now, you can do things like this:

    clitunes play
    clitunes pause
    clitunes stop
